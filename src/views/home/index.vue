          In 2023, the World War III broke out and ended in nuclear war, Human
          civilization disappeared...

          <br />
          In 2035, the surviving Panda Family, due to the contamination of
          nuclear radiation, had genetic mutations in their bodies, evolved into
          a high-IQ race, and began to rule the Earth...

          In 2058, due to the destruction of nuclear pollution and war, the

          In 2141, the war of the Panda Family began between the stars
          <br />

          In 2169, on the Planet M78 of the Sagittarius Î± galaxy, a war between
